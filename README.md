# blindfold-chess-bot

## Summary

Current top chess websites like lichess.org and chess.com offer options for blindfold play. Users are given a blank board, and streamed moves are highlighted on it. However, this isn't pure blindfold as the highlights and boardview reduce user emphasis on visualization.

Our goal is to create a bot that acts as an intermediary to allow for pure blindfold games to be played online. Through text-to-speech and speech recognition, users will be able to say their moves out loud, and hear their opponent's moves without having a reduction in their blindfold chess experience.
